CloudSphere

CloudSphere is a simple, fully responsive web project built while following a tutorial series by Mosh Hamedani. The objective of the project was to reinforce foundational concepts in HTML and CSS, explore modern styling techniques, and improve overall front-end development proficiency.

Project Overview

CloudSphere represents a fictional cloud-service landing page designed to highlight essential front-end skills. Although the project structure is inspired by the tutorial, the development involved hands-on practice, personal experimentation, and incremental improvement to ensure mastery of core concepts.

The site includes key UI sections such as:

Hero banner

Product features

Pricing overview

Testimonials

Contact/CTA section

Responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop

Motivation

I built CloudSphere to:

Review the basics of HTML and CSS.

Practice clean, semantic markup and scalable CSS structure.

Gain confidence in layout systems such as Flexbox and CSS Grid.

Learn new techniques and best practices demonstrated by Mosh, whose teaching style I enjoy.

Strengthen my workflow in preparing for more advanced full-stack projects.

What I Learned

Effective use of semantic HTML to improve accessibility and structure.

Building responsive layouts using media queries, flexbox, and grid.

Creating visually consistent UI components with reusable CSS classes.

Organizing a project folder for maintainability (assets, styles, pages).

Understanding core design principles such as spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy.

Tech Stack

HTML5 – structure and content

CSS3 – styling, layout, responsiveness

Google Fonts / Custom Fonts – typography

Vanilla JavaScript (optional) – minor interactivity if needed

Status

CloudSphere is a practice project and may be extended over time as I continue to refine my front-end skills and explore new design patterns.
